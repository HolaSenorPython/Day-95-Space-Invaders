## Space Invaders!🕹️🎮

This project is my remake of the arcade classic Space invaders, done entirely in Python with
Turtle graphics. Shoot up aliens at 60 fps. I hope you can enjoy. I've beat it a few times myself already 😅

## Notes and Features 🤠
- Alien pellet code was originally exactly like player pellet code. Caused lots of problems down the line. ChatGPT mentored me to a fix 😭😭
- Aliens are in triangle shape, so there is a slight quirk in which the spaceship pellet flies through the margins between the aliens
- Game can only be exited by closing window
- Runs at around 60 fps due to screen update logic

## I wanna play! How? 🙏
1. Clone this repo or download it
  - git clone https://github.com/HolaSenorPython/Day-95-Space-Invaders.git
2. Create a venv (optional, but recommended)
  - (Note, usually an IDE like pycharm will ask and do it for you)
  - python -m venv venv
  - source venv/bin/activate
3. Dependencies
  - This program doesn't use any external libraries/modules outside of what comes with installing Python on your computer.
  - **Python 3.9** or above is all you need
4. Run the program! 🚀🎮
